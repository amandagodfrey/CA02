#This code will use training variables to create the best fit model to predict whether emails are spam or not. 
We will first deconstruct the content of emails and create a dictionary that will contain a set of determining words. 
We will filter the emails with these determining words and train the system to understand what is considered spam. 
Lastly, testing variables will be put through the model to see if there is a good accuracy rate.
